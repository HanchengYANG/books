<b>Snippet:</b>

int cnt, square, cube;
 for (cnt=1 ; cnt <= 10; cnt++) {
   if(cnt % 3 == 0)
      continue;
   square = cnt * cnt;
   cube = cnt * cnt * cnt;
   System.out.printf("\nSquare of %d is %d and Cube is %d", cnt, square, cube);
   }

The code declares a variable cnt and uses the for statement which contains the initialization, termination and increment expression. In the body of the loop, the value of cnt is divided by 3 and the remainder is checked. If the remainder is 0, the continue statement is used to skip the rest of the statements in the body of the loop. If remainder is not 0, the if statement evaluates to false, and the square and cube of cnt is calculated and displayed.

Output:
Square of 1 is 1 and Cube is 1
Square of 2 is 4 and Cube is 8
Square of 4 is 16 and Cube is 64
Square of 5 is 25 and Cube is 125
Square of 7 is 49 and Cube is 343
Square of 8 is 64 and Cube is 512
Square of 10 is 100 and Cube is 1000
